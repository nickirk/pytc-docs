- **JAX-based automatic differentiation** for Jastrow gradients and Laplacians via [folx](https://github.com/microsoft/folx) — single-pass forward Laplacian, JIT-compiled to fused GPU kernels, avoiding the cost of finite differences entirely.
- **Multi-GPU acceleration** via JAX sharding for both VMC sampling and integral evaluation — near-linear strong scaling across devices with no user-side code changes.
- **Transcorrelated integrals**: K1, K2, K3 two-body and xTC approximated three-body integrals — fully GPU-resident contractions, never materialising the 3-body tensor explicitly.
- **Interpolative Separable Density Fitting (ISDF)** for the xTC kernel — empirical $T \propto n_{\mathrm{orb}}^{1.76}$ scaling (see plot above) pushes routine calculations past 1200 orbitals on a single B200, which is beyond what standard quantum chemistry solvers can handle.
- **Modular Jastrow factors**: Boys-Handy, Nuclear Cusp, Neural Network (EE/EN/EEN), REXP, Polynomial, and Composite — share the same JIT-compiled evaluation path, so adding a new factor adds zero per-step overhead.
- **VMC-based Jastrow optimization** with second-order Newton and first-order ML optimizers (Adam) — second-order steps reach the same accuracy in an order of magnitude fewer iterations than SGD.
- **PySCF interoperability with JAX-native CCSD**: Builds on PySCF mean-field objects and molecular data, then runs xTC-CCSD with PyTC's in-house JAX solver
